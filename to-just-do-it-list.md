## TO DO
- (Up to Siege & stress test - check) Go through the eval sheet, check whether we have everything in place, add to the list if something is missing
- Add additional check to configuration parsing - we shouldn't allow multiple ports in one server
- Add a different homepage for another server, maybe?
- CGI stuff

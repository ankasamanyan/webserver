## TO DO
- Go through the eval sheet, check whether we have everything in place, add to the list if something is missing
- (Masha) Figure out the correct order of processing the information from configuration file (what comes first: redirection, saving the default file, saving uploads directory)
- Display error pages according to the configuration file
- CGI stuff

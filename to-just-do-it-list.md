## TO DO
- Go through the eval sheet, check whether we have everything in place, add to the list if something is missing
- (Masha) Change the order of request processing so that redirection comes first
- Limit maximum amount of consecutive redirections
- Ignore the directory from URL when POSTing, take it from uploads_directory or take a default one
- Display error pages according to the configuration file
- CGI stuff

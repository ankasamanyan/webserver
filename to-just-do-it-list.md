## TO DO
- (Up to Configuration - check) Go through the eval sheet, check whether we have everything in place, add to the list if something is missing
- Remove client if an error occured after send/write/recv/read (check for both 0 and -1)
- Leave 1 send per Client per select (Can we? Should we?ðŸ¤”)
- Figure out why we have GET request to pictures in a loop (to reproduce: with a default config try to access /errorHrml)
- CGI stuff

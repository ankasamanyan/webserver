# Webserv

Webserv is a project in the 42 core curriculum that focuses on building a basic HTTP server. The goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of web servers, HTTP protocols, and network programming.

## Features

- **HTTP Protocol**: Implements essential parts of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, including request methods (GET, POST, etc.) and response status codes.
- **Configuration**: Supports server configuration through a configuration file, allowing users to specify server properties and routes.
- **Static Content**: Handles static content such as HTML, CSS, and images, serving them to clients upon request.
- **CGI(Common Gateway Interface)**: standard protocol that enables web server to execute a script, generating dynamic web content in response to user requests (GET and POST).
